# WP Discourse Sync
Automatically creates Wordpress posts for Discourse Topics, powered by Discourse webhooks.
Let your users write articles in the comfortable Discourse environment
and stay away from the spooky Wordpress admin panel.

## Todo
- Add to Wordpress Plugin Directory.
- Write a quick install guide.
- Make WP cascade 'move to trash' to 'relations'
- Add Custom CSS scoped to the content.
- Add automatic link (button) to Discourse Topic in WP Post.
- Pass-trough the Discourse author. (auto-create WP authors ?)
- Add a 'ignore' trigger.
- Sync Discourse comments to Wordpress.
- ~~Pass-trough Discourse pins to WP.~~

I'm not a PHP dev so if anything looks goofy and needs to be fixed, Open a new Issue.
